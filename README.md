# MarioAI-

Setup: Run on Python 3

pip3 install gym-super-mario-bros

aiMario.py trains and stores in Brain.txt

winSet.txt holds a list of the winning moveset with the best time

runModel.py uses winSet.txt to try and reproduce the win. Due to the step function being tied to CPU speed, this rarely works
